# Recent News @RIPLRT!!!

### *A Puerto Rican joins the RIPLRT*

Sukeina Nasser, 2nd year pharmacy students at Larkin University, joins the Respiratory and Immunology Project and Laboratory. Sukie, as we call her, similar to Dr. Felix E. Rivera Mariani, has Puerto Rican heritage -- her mom is from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Although Sukie's mom moved to the US to study University of Michigan (English and Biochemistry), all her mom family still live in Puerto Rico. Also, her family in Puerto Rico experienced 1st hand the effects of Hurricane Maria. Therefore, Sukie greatly values the environmental health work the RIPLRT is doing with the Universities of Puerto Rico and Texas.
