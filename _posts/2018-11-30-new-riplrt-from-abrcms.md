Summer Pellechio, who recently attended the 2018 Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority (ABRMCS) which took place in Indianapolis, Indiana from November 14 to 17th, and earn a poster award in the section of Computational and System Biology, is the most recent addition to the RIPL_Effect Research Team. At ABRCMS 2018, Summer was able to network with Dr. Rivera-Mariani, and exchange professional and personal goals. After some thoughts and interviewing with members of the RIPLRT (whom were very impressed by Summer), she recently accepted to join the RIPL_Eeffect Research Team (RIPLRT).

Summer is a recent gradaute from the Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY) with a B.S. Biomedical Sciences. She is an aspiring Physician Assistant, and will bring lots of casrisma, knowledge, and an open-mindset into the RIPLRT -- she has both research and clinical experience, including being an EMT and "vampire" (a.k.a. phlebotomist). 

Summer will begin with us starting March 2019. We look forward to having Summer contribute her knowledge and carisma with the RIPLRT, and to mentor her towards her short and long term professional and personal goals.

Welcome Summer!
