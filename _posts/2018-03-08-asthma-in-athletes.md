<b>Musheer Abdalhuk</b>, <i>member of the Editorial Team</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, addressed in his presentation if athletes do have a higher risk of asthma. The article Musheer presented was published by <i>Burns, J. et al. in 2015</i> in the Respiratory Medicine journal (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013359" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the authors' findings were that athletes do not necessarily have a higher risk of asthma; however, the normal population that engages in high-endurance or aquatic sports (e.g. swimming) do have a higher risk of suffering from asthma. This goes in line with the recommendation that performing high-endurance sports among the normal population should be closely monitored by experts in the field of endurance training.
