title: A review of our science outreach through the web
subtitle: From addressing respiratory health to discussing the opioid epidemic
---

*By Felix E. Rivera-Mariani, PhD*

Since the moment we established our scientific research team within the College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University in early 2018, among our <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/mission/" target="_blank">core values</a> have been diversity, inclusiveness, and multidisciplinarity, among others. Due to these core values, members of our research team have been engaging in sharing their scientific knowledge with the public through blogs. In this blog, I take the opportunity to highlight these blogs, all of which share useful information for the public to take action and improve their personal health.

On October 26th, 2018, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Shandra%20Bellinger" target="_blank">Shandra Bellinger</a> (Research Assistant - Intern of the RIPLRT) discussed on the topic of <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2018-10-26-airpollution-and-human-health/" target="_blank">how air pollution not only affects our respiratory health but also the health of other organs in our body</a> (e.g. heart, fetal health, nervous, urinary, and digestive systems).

In line with Shandra's blog, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Hayat%20Srour" target="_blank">Hayat Srour</a> (Lab Manager / Research Assistant of the RIPLRT) blogged on November 2nd, 2018 on the importance of <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2018-11-02-dont-must-just-yet/" target="_blank"> considering pollution levels</a> in the cities and localities as one of the variables for prospective homebuyers to consider when selecting where to purchase their house.

The next blog, which was authored by <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Joshua%20Baguley" target="_blank">Joshua Baguley</a> (Research Assistant - Intern of the RIPLRT) on November 12th, 2018, addressed higher education. In this blog, Josh shared his <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2018-11-12-lessons-of-scientific-research/" target="_blank">experience and the benefits for engaging in scientific research</a> in undergrad, post-baccalaureate, and other levels of higher education prior to applying to professional or graduate programs.

Back into human health, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Ruslan%20Fomenko" target="_blank">Ruslan Fomenko</a> (Research Assistant - Intern) published a blog on November 16th, 2018, in which he <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2018-11-16-vaccines-and-autism/" target="_blank"> argues (with scientific evidence) against the myth</a> that vaccines are the cause of the epidemic of autism.

<img src="/img/winter-allergies.jpg" alt="Winter Allergies" align="left" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Tackling the topic of seasonal allergies, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Ariel%20Stateman" target="_blank">Ariel Stateman</a> (Research Assistant - Intern in the RIPLRT), shared on November 24th, 2018 some interventions people can implement to reduce their <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2018-11-24-winter-and-allergies/" target="_blank"> incidence of allergies during the winter</a>.

<img src="/img/opioid-map.jpg" alt="Opioid Epidemic Map" align="right" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Shifting a bit from our line of research, but still an important topic in public health, is the opioid crisis. As the first blog of the current year (2019) for the RIPLRT, Hayat Srour blogged on January 4th, 2019 about the <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-01-04-opioid-epidemic/" target="_blank">possible variables</a> that have contributed to the current and emergent opioid crisis.

Shandra Bellinger is one of member who is very jelous with her diet -- we are still trying to develop a plan to get her to eat pork. In this line, she blogged on January 12th, 2019 about the <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-01-12-asthma-diet/" target="_blank">links between diet and asthma </a>. Note that diet has been linked to the increase asthma incidence among countries of the Western hemisphere.

<img src="/img/immunotherapy.png" alt="immunotherapy" align="right" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
On another note, it is not only important to know about how diseases developed but also for alternative on how they can be treated. On this manner, Ruslan Fomenko blogged on January 19th, 2019 on <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-01-12-asthma-diet/" target="_blank"> how immunotherapy</a> has been contributing in addressing the incidence of seasonal and non-seasonal allergies.

<img src="/img/allergy1.png" alt="Allergic Rhinitis" align="left" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Following Ruslan's footsteps (or maybe conspiring) on the topic of immunotherapy, Josh Baguley blogged on February 13th, 2019 about the <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-02-13-allergy-treatment-options/" target="_blank"> benefits of immunotherapy</a> to circumvent chronic allergies.

<img src="/img/ezcema.png" alt="Ezcema" align="right" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Because allergies are not biased towards the respiratory track, Hayat Srour blogged on February 22nd, 2019 on a chronic allergic disease of the skin -- <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-02-22-you-have-ezcema/" target="_blank">ezcema</a>.

<img src="/img/airpollutionpyramid.png" alt="Air pollution pyramid" align="left" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Goign beyond the bench, Shandra Bellinger addressed on March 9th, 2019 the possibility of considering air pollution exposure <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-03-09-air-pollution-as-cause-of-death/" target="_blank">as a possible cause</a> of death in legal documents. Air pollution is linked to the development of chronic diseases, why not as a cause of death>?

<img src="/img/seasonal-allergies.png" alt="Seasonal Allergies" align="right" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
Ariel Stateman, who in late in 2018 blogged about winter allergies, on April 2nd, 2019 discussed that allergies do not discriminate by age -- <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-04-02-but-i-never-had-seasonal-allergies/" target="_blank">they can developed at anytime in our lifetimes</a>.

<img src="/img/histology-smoke.png" alt="Carbon molecules in lung tissue" align="left" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin:8px">
On April 4th, 2019, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Summer%20Pellechio" target="_blank">Summer Pellechio</a>, who just recently joined the RIPLRT, address how smoking exposure basically can wipe out and cause dysfunction on the cells of the respiratory tract -- <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-04-04-cells-react-to-smoke/" target="_blank">in an analogy of how air pollution can wipe out coral reefs</a>. Summer is so excited to join the group that she will be driving from New York to join the group (wow Summer!)

And more recently, on April, 12th, 2019, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Bhavikkumar%20Patel" target="_blank">Bhavik Patel</a>, a current student of the College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University and who also recently joined the RIPLRT, touched on the potential high loads and chronic allergen exposures from dirty carpet. <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-04-12-whats-living-in-your-carpet/" target="_blank">Yes...we need to keep our carpets clean</a>!

Well, here you have a half year worth of insightful blogs by prospective scientists and physicians -- among the future of the scientific and healthcare workforce in the USA! 

More than enough reason for <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Dr.%20F%C3%A9lix%20E.%20Rivera-Mariani" target="_blank">Dr. Rivera-Mariani</a> to be proud of his reasearch team!
