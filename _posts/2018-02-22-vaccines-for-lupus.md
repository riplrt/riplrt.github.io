**Ruslan Fomenko**, *Certified Phlebotomist* of the RIPL_Effect research team, delivered to the audience an interesting topic: attenuated T cells as a vaccine strategy in Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE). This topic was published by <i>Huang et al. in 2016</i> in the Journal of Immunological Research (<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2016/5183686/" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). In this self-controlled study, the authors extracted T cells from the patients, attenuated the extracted T cells by irradiation, and re-administered the attenudated T cells to the patients. The authors of the study reported that this vaccination strategy reduced anti-DNA antibodies and symptoms common among patients with SLE.
