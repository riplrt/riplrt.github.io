<b>Angel Jordan</b>, <i>Administrative Leader</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, and aspiring surgeon, presented a Journal Club talk on the topic of respiratory health and depression. The article Angel discussed was published by <i>DeWaters A.L., et al. de Andrade, L.</i> (2018) in the <i>American Journal of the Medical Sciences</i> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289257" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the author's findings were that being hospitalized with pneumonia and, at the same time, suffering from depression lead to higher mortality risks. This finding highlights the need to address mental health outcomes that take place concurrently with other diseases.
