---


As evidence of our efforts to contribute to the Open Science movement, the RIPLRT submitted two manuscripts (see below) into the Open Access platform [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/). These manuscripts employed data science approaches into publicly-available datasets to address topics relted to a) asthma and forest firest and b) the mixed effects of demographics and food allergies as risk for asthma. 

1) Hayat Srour, Ruslan Fomenko, Joshua Baguley, Shandra Bellinger, Angel Jordan, Jennifer Sutton, Melany Santana, Armando Marull, Musheer Abdalhuk,  Félix E. Rivera-Mariani. Pilot Study of Public-Available Data to Evaluate the Relationship between Forest Fires and Emergency Department Visits due to asthma in the State of California.

(<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15831.1" target="_blank">click here for the article</a>).
