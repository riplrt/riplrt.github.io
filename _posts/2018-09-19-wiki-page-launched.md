title: RIPLRT Launched a Wiki Page
subtitle: Lab information and resources in one place!
--- 

In our efforts to contribute to the Open Science movement, and to facilitate access to information and resources among the RIPLRT team members (including prospective ones), the RIPLRT has launched a [Wiki Page](https://wiki.riplrt.com).

<a href="https://wiki.riplrt.com/">
  <img src="/img/wiki-page.png" alt="RIPL_Effect Research Team" class="inline"/>
</a>

Among the contents of the [RIPLRT Wiki](https://wiki.riplrt.com) page are the following:

- Lab Orientation: everyone joining @RIPLRT must go through lab orientation
- Lab Management: house-keeping approaches for @RIPLRT daily activities
- Experiments: guides on how to properly design, carry out, and document experiments with @RIPLRT
- Forms: lab manual and other important forms related to @RIPLRT
- In the Cloud: databases employed by @RIPLRT
- Open Science: @RIPLRT supports the the Open Science movement!
- Resources: learning, scientific, and computational resources used by @RIPLRT

We would like to thank the [Alylab](https://www.alylab.org/)(1) for sharing in a recent issue of [Nature News & Comments](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06167-w) the benefits of having a wiki page as well as elaborating a manual.
