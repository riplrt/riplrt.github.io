**Shandra Bellinger**, *Lead Editor* of the RIPL_Effect research team, was the first  student to give a seminar in the Journal Club series sponsored by the RIPL_Effect research team. She presented a very interesting topic: human immune system manipulation to deliver anti-cancer cytotoxicity to colon and prostate cancer cells. This topic was published by *Mitchell et al. in 2014* in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/3/930" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). In this study, the authors induced the expression of adhesion molecules commonly expressed the surface of cancer cell on blood-circulating leukocytes. The rationale of inducing these protein is that cancer cells circulating in the blood interact with blood vessels in a manner similar to leukocytes.
