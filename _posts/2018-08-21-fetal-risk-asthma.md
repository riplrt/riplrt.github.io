<b>Hayat Srour</b>, <i>Spokesperson and Financial Officer</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, and aspiring physician who want to address global equality, presented a Journal Club talk on the topic of fetal stress from air pollution and its role in childhood asthma. The article Hayat discussed was published by <i>Yue A.L. et al. </i> (2017) in the journal <i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935613" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the author's findings were that maternal exposure during gestational stages to indoor pollution can lead to cellular (e.g. cytokine secretions) and gene expression changes (e.g. DNA methylation/unmethylation) that can potentiate the development of allergic asthma in the offspring. This article further highlights the important of indoor air pollution in human health.
