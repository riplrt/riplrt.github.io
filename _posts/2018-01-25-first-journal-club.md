The RIPL_Effect Research Team (RIPLRT) launches its Journal Club with its very first speaker, [Dr. FÃ©lix E. Rivera-Mariani](https://www.friveram.com), Principal Investigator of the RIPLRT. Dr. Rivera-Mariani's topic was *"Speaking the Language of Science"*, in which he discussed discussed the epicycles of generating a peer-review manuscript and approaches to make the manuscript publication-ready. Dr. Rivera-Mariani also discussed with the audience the article <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312192282_Serological_Reactivity_and_Identification_of_IgE-Binding_Polypeptides_of_Ganoderma_applanatum_Crude_Spore_Cytoplasmic_Extract_in_Puerto_Rican_Subjects" target="_blank">Serological Reactivity and Identification of IgE-Binding Polypeptides of Ganoderma applanatum Crude Spore Cytoplasmic Extract in Puerto Rican Subjects</a>.
