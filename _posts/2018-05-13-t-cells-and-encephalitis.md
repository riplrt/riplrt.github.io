<b>Armando Marull</b>, member of the <i>Quality Assurance Team</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, delivered a presentation of a very interesting topic: inducing regulatory T cells to suppress the physiological mechanisms that participate in the health outcomes of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The article Armando presented was published by <i>Zohar, Y. et al. in 2014</i> in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713654" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the authors' findings were that administration of anti-CXCL11 antibodies prevented remission and relapse of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This reduced remission and relapse resulted from reduced concentration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the autoimmune site.
