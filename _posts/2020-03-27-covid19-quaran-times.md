title: COVID-19...Quaran-Times!
subtitle: A discussion on self-isolation during the new-age pandemic

*By Donna Oh, Kylie Daguio, Nicole Benavides, Adria  Guajardo Allen, Shana Zadron.*

<p>As soon as the world greeted the turn of the decade, it seemed that the new year was determined to make its mark in recent history. Like checking off a crisis to-do list, 2020 has sacked and pillaged through each month so far with a “hot-spot” item:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>January</b> was riddled with international and national uncertainties.</li>
	<li><b>February</b> tried to burn Australia down.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, by the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> month, we are all (hopefully) sitting at home, at least 6 feet away from other humans and with a bottle of hand-sanitizer loaded and ready. Maybe some toilet paper too, if you were lucky. So while we connect wirelessly through screens and speakers, and leave our doors firmly shut to the outside world, 2020 can successfully check off its third item on the list:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>March</b>: the COVID-19 Pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent use of the word “pandemic” was in 2009, when a known influenza virus (the H1N1) mutated into a novel and highly virulent form (<a href="https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-pandemic-vs-swine-flu.html" target="_blank">LiveScience</a>). Dubbed the “Swine Flu” for its endemic origins in pigs, this virus infected more than 1.4 billion people around the world in the course of the year before the end of the pandemic was declared in 2010 (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>).</p>

<p>Ten years later, we are presently and aggressively faced with a novel coronavirus called <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it" target="_blank">SARS-CoV-2</a> that can lead to acute severe respiratory illnesses. The resulting disease, officially named <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html" target="_blank" >COVID-19</a>, has seen an unprecedented rate of transmission among people, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases in 175 countries – and climbing. Government and healthcare agencies in almost all countries have responded to this extraordinary circumstance by levying public mandates and, in some countries, laws that dictate the one underlying word we are by now all familiar with: <b>Quarantine</b>.</p>

	<h2><i>But why?</i></h2>
</header>

<img src="/img/covid19-2.png" alt="The SARS-CoV-2 virus" align="left" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; margin:8px">
<p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (see image on the left), which person to person or contact with contaminated surfaces; nevertheless, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973" target="_blank">a recent study</a> highlighted its aerosol viability (i.e. up to three hours). It ranges from being asymptomatic to complications as intense as organ failure leading to death. If this virus spreads from human contact, who wouldn’t want to be quarantined? Well, for those of you doubting these isolation tactics, here are some facts from the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>:</p>


<blockquote><b>Wash Your Hands</b>. If you were not already practicing this, you may have bigger problems at stake. Washing hands with soap and water kills any bacteria or virus that you may have picked up. Most viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, contain a protective, yet weak, viral envelope that is made of fat, and aids in the spreading of the virus: this holds true to viruses that can cause respiratory diseases and spread perso-to-person or following contact with contaminated surfaces. Inside this fatty envelope are its protein and genetic code. Viruses cannot survive alone and need a host. Due to the acidity of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, the virus cannot puncture it; instead, it sticks to the surface. Soap’s chemical structure is attracted to the coronavirus’s fatty envelope, causing it to detach from the skin and break off into small viral pieces. The soap molecules continue to trap these small viral pieces, making it easier for water to come in and wash it away. Hand sanitizer is handy (comprised of at least 60% alcohol), but nothing beats a good ole’ hand wash.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Social Distancing</b>. How does it feel when someone is coughing and sneezing in your personal space? Not too hot. Now imagine someone doing that during this pandemic. Constantly staying at least 6 feet apart may seem lonely, but trust the professionals. When an individual sneezes or coughs, miniscule respiratory droplets from the nose or mouth become airborne. If you are not practicing safe social distancing, you can breathe in these virus-containing droplets. Social distancing and being quarantined is not just to protect yourself; it is to help manage and control the spread that could more severely harm older populations and individuals with underlying medical concerns. When you are going stir-crazy, confined within the four walls of your living quarters, think of all the grandparents with immune systems not as strong as yours.</blockquote> 

<blockquote><b>History Repeats Itself</b>. The National Academy of Medicine recently hosted a conference-<b><i>Responding to COVID-19: A Science-Based Approach</i></b>, terming quarantine a Non-pharmaceutical Intervention beneficial for the containment and mitigation of COVID-19. According to research on the influenza pandemics, experts are able to predict the impact of quarantine on the transmission of the virus. Not only does it reduce the risk of an outbreak to the public health, but it buys time for sciensits and healthcare professionals to develop a treatment or vaccine. In the meantime, keep calm and hold tight.</blockquote>

	<h2><i>Still, there are caveats.</i></h2>
</header>

<p>There’s no doubting the science behind social distancing; however, it has its downfalls. Here are topics that policymakers ponder about: (1) the danger of quarantine in an abusive home, (2) the increased risk associated with homelessness, (3) the mental health issues pertinent to self-isolation, (4) the access to food to children in low socioeconomic households, and (5) the negative effects on the economy.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe a few short months ago there was a talk about record gains in the stock market. Like many major disruptive events, this crisis is sure to place great strain on the economy. Investors' panic has caused massive losses across the entire stock market, one of countless factors that led to drastic losses in stock price. This among many other factors places a great strain on the US economy.</p>

Barren streets and empty skyscrapers show the overwhelming obedience in favor of self-isolation. <b><i>Quaran-times</i></b> has become an electronic playground for many, streaming movie after movie (and TV series) while endlessly browsing the internet. Hell, even worklife is home-based. Life in cyberspace is being spoiled with the stench of monotony, and for the time being, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel is still small and far.

When it comes to quarantine, how long is too long? Perhaps in the eyes of the general public the caveats to social distancing will negate its seemingly short-term pros. Nonetheless, before levying the promotion on self-isolation, policymakers must consider a secondary outbreak. But, more importantly, beyond the decisions of suits and ties behind their table-top fortresses, it comes down to the people to act on informed decisions to mitigate the worst of the damage. It might be too late to hit the e-break on 2020’s vengeance, but steering the car through less turbulent roads ahead may make all the difference. Timing is everything -- at a time like this, it's important to remain proactive and stay safe.
