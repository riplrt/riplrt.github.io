Members of the RIPL_Effect Research Team took a moment out of their busy lab agendas to polish an important in the lab: eye-to-hand coordination. RIPLRTs, including Dr. Rivera-Mariani, competed among themselves to find who really has what it takes to perform fast techniques but at the same time being as accurate as possible. Among the exercises were replacing the pipetting tips into their corresponding boxes and pipetting specific volumes of water while being timed. Important to note that Dr. Rivera-Mariani was not the champ in both competitions. Is age taking its told on Dr. Rivera-Mariani? jaja!
