<b>Melany Santana</b>, <i>Lab Manager </i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, from the state of Florida, and aspiring cardiovascular surgeon, shared her Journal Club talk on the topic of chronic respiratory diseases (such as asthma) among different hispanic populations. The article Melany discussed was published by <i>Barr R.G. et al. </i> (2016) in the <i>American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care Medicine</i> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26451874" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the authors' findings were that asthma was more prevalent among the following groups: Puerto Ricans, Hispanics born in the US or immigrated to the US as children. According to the authors, this distribution was not observed among COPD, which is another chronic respiratory disease.
