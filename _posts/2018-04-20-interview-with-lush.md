<b>Dr. Rivera-Marinai</b>, Principal Investigator of our RIPL_Effect research team, was recently interviewed by the <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/about/about/about-pcrm" target="_blank">Physicians Committee of Medicine</a> on the topic of Animal-Free research and toxicological testing. Dr. Rivera-Mariani was an awardee, in 2012, of the <a href="https://lushprize.org/past-years/2012-prize/lush-prize-winners-2012/young-researcher-prize-winners-2012/" target="_blank">Lush Young Researcher Award</a>, granted by the <a href="http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/" target="_blank">Ethical Consumer Association (London, UK)</a>, for his efforts in expanding existing human-based immunological approaches as an alternative to animal-free testing. For this reason, the Physicians Committee of Medicine, as part of the Young Scientists Project, approached Dr. Rivera-Mariani to provide his view on the following: 1) what lead Dr. Rivera-Mariani to conduct research without the use of animals, 2) challenges he has faced with the decision to not use animals in his research, and 3) advice on how best connect to and support young scientists that want to pursue non-animal research.
