In line with recent blogs <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-05-02-mentors-unsung-heroes/" target="_blank">Ruslan Fomenko</a>, and <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-05-17-mentors/" target="_blank">Shandra Bellinger</a> about mentoring, the RIPLRT's hands will be fully engaged in mentoring this summer with three interns.

<a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Naziba%20Nuha" target="_blank"> Naziba Nuha</a>, undergraduate student (sophmore) enrolled in the B.S. in Biology and Mathematics with minor in Chemistry at Nova Southeastern University (NSU)

Lorraine, mentored by <a href="https://md.rcm.upr.edu/micro/dt_team/dr-benjamin-bolanos/" target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Bolañsos-Rosero</a> (former PhD thesis mentor of Dr. Rivera-Mariani), is a 3rd-year graduate student looking forward to learning the human-based immunological approaches the team of Dr. Rivera-Mariani implements in environmental health studies. She also seeks training in the experimental design and planning, as well as the project planning and management the RIPLRT implements in studies addressing the respiratory health effects from human exposure to air pollution of different contaminating origins. 

Naziba, who this term completed her first year as undergraduate student at NSU, seeks to immerse herself in the diffeerent aspects of scientific research. Interestingly, Naziba learn about the RIPLRT from her scribe co-worker <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Hayat%20Srour" target="_blank">Hayat Srour</a>, who is our lab manager at the RIPLRT. Tanha, who learned about the RIPLRT through Naziba, completed her sophmore year at NSU. She is looking forward to expand her previous research experiences, and is really interested in the public health effort we are currently invovled with, such as the collaboration to address the respiratory health of Puerto Ricans in the aftermath of hurricane Maria.
