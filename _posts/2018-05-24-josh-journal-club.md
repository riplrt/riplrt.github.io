<b>Joshua Baguley</b>, one of the <i>Co-Leaders</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, and aspiring physician, presented a Journal Club talk on the topic of inhibition of proteases that are expressed on tumor cells and help them evade immune recognition. The article Josh presented was published by <i>Ferrari de Andrade, L.</i> earlier this year (2018) in the <i>Science</i> journal (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599246" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the author's findings were that blocking proteases through specific antibodies reactivated the antitumor immunity mediated by Natural Killer cells and thus inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent animal models. The findings from the study presented by Josh have clinical implication, such as a possible immunotherapy approach in cancer.
