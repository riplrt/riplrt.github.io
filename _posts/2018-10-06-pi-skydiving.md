Our mentor and principal investigator, [Dr. Rivera-Mariani](https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Dr.%20F%C3%A9lix%20E.%20Rivera-Mariani), is somewhat of a particular guy. He is former student-athlete in division I NCAA athletics, has handyman skills, plenty of web-development and computational knowledge. Let's add that he continues to follow sports and praciting sports (when time allows), including xtreme sports -- like jumping from a plan at 14,000 and freefalling at 120 mph. ***Yes, he went skydiving (see below)!***

This past weekend (Sept 30<sup>th</sup>), Dr. Rivera-Mariani and Mrs. Martínez-Rivera (who also went skydiving) were celebrating two-year wedding anniversary. Among the surprises organized by Mrs. Martínez-Rivera was to take Dr. Rivera-Mariani skydiving to the Skydive Spaceland in Clewiston, FL. *According to our sources, they plan to jump again in the near future!*
