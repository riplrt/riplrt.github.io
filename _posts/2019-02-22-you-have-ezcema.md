When I think of eczema, I think about our skin, the protective shield, fighting itself. The irony in this statement must be addressed. More commonly people may think that eczema is just dry itchy skin but this skin disorder has a little more to it. This blog’s main goal is to present information on eczema.

Eczema is a medical condition that presents itself as red, itchy, rough, blistering skin. While the causes of eczema are unknown, the onset of this conditions can happen any time and affect anyone. It is also important to note there is a genetic component to the condition. For example it is understood that is someone in your family has Atopic dermatitis (a form of eczema)there is a 50% chance their children will have it (<a href="https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/types-of-eczema/atopic-dermatitis/" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a>). 

Eczema can come in two forms: atopic and contact dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is the form that usually presents in infants (first six months) and has characteristic appearance areas. Contact dermatitis is the form that is acute and usually due to a substance irritant such as a chemical.

Eczema can appear episodically and have certain triggers, both internal and external. External triggers include allergens, irritants, and weather, whereas internal triggers include food or stress.
