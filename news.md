	<h4>RIPL_Effect's Journal Club: Antibody-mediated Inhibition Proteases of Tumor Cells</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify"><p> <i>May 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018</i>. <b>Joshua Baguley</b>, one of the <i>Co-Leaders</i> of the RIPL_Effect research team, and aspiring physician, presented a Journal Club talk on the topic of inhibition of proteases that are expressed on tumor cells and help them evade immune recognition. The article Josh presented was published by <i>Ferrari de Andrade, L.</i> earlier this year (2018) in the <i>Science</i> journal (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599246" target="_blank">click here to access the article</a>). Among the author's findings were that blocking proteases through specific antibodies reactivated the antitumor immunity mediated by Natural Killer cells and thus inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent animal models. The findings from the study presented by Josh have clinical implication, such as a possible immunotherapy approach in cancer.</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify"><p> <i>April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2018</i>. <b>Dr. Rivera-Marinai</b>, Principal Investigator of our RIPL_Effect research team, was recently interviewed by the <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/about/about/about-pcrm" target="_blank">Physicians Committee of Medicine</a> on the topic of Animal-Free research and toxicological testing. Dr. Rivera-Mariani was an awardee, in 2012, of the <a href="https://lushprize.org/past-years/2012-prize/lush-prize-winners-2012/young-researcher-prize-winners-2012/" target="_blank">Lush Young Researcher Award</a>, granted by the <a href="http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/" target="_blank">Ethical Consumer Association (London, UK)</a>, for his efforts in expanding existing human-based immunological approaches as an alternative to animal-free testing. For this reason, the Physicians Committee of Medicine, as part of the Young Scientists Project, approached Dr. Rivera-Mariani to provide his view on the following: 1) what lead Dr. Rivera-Mariani to conduct research without the use of animals, 2) challenges he has faced with the decision to not use animals in his research, and 3) advice on how best connect to and support young scientists that want to pursue non-animal research.</p></div>
