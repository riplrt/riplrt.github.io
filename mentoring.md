title: Mentoring in RIPLRT
subtitle: Our strategies to mentor our RIPLRT members
---

As stated by <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Ruslan%20Fomenko" target="_blank">Ruslan Fomenko</a> in a <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-05-02-mentors-unsung-heroes/" target="_blank">mentoring blog</a>, *"A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself" (by Oprah Winfrey).* Also, <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Shandra%20Bellinger" target="_blank">Shandra Bellinger</a> further elaborates that there are <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/2019-05-17-mentors/" target="_blank">different types of mentors</a> (and different circumstances merit different mentoring styles), and mentoring is also a two-way street. Not only mentees but also mentors need to understand this inter-engaging relationship.

The RIPL_Effect Research Team (RIPLRT) takes pride in act of mentoring, starting from our <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/members/#Dr.%20F%C3%A9lix%20E.%20Rivera-Mariani" target="_blank">Principal Investigator (Dr. Rivera-Mariani)</a>, lab mananger, research assistants, and event undergraduate interns. Everyone in the RIPLRT engages in mentoring!

Among the areas the RIPLRT address in mentoring include, but are not limited to:

- [Experimental Techniques](#Experimental Techniques)
- [Experimental Planning and Design](#Experimental Planning and Design)
- [Experimental Documentation](#Experimental Documentation)
- [Project Planning and Management](#Project Planning and Management)
- [Budget and Inventory Management](#Budget and Inventory Management)
- [Scientific Writing](#Scientific Writing)
- [Grant Writing](#Grant Writing)
- [Data Science](#Data Science)
- [Writing for Non-scientific Audience](#Writing for Non-scientific Audience)
- [Peer-Review](#Peer-Review)
- [Team Work](#Team Work)
- [Communication](#Communication)
- [Leadership](#Leadership)
- [Career Planning](#Career Planning)

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Experimental Techniques"></a><b><i>Experimental Techniques</i></b>.In the laboratory setting, scientific researchn employs a pletora of laboratory techniques. These techniques include routine (e.g. pipetting, preparation of solutions, environmental sample collectiona and extractions, collection of human samples, etc.) and non-routine (e.g. ELISA, Western blots, DNA and protein extractions, flow cytometry, "omics" technologies, human whole blood pyrogen assay, etc.). The RIPLRT maintains Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), and mastering these techniques and approaches are key to weekly and project-specific activities we emply. Also, veteran members (not only the PI) in the RIPLRT are eager mentoring in routine and innovative techniques. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Experimental Planning and Design"></a><i><b>Experimental Planning and Design</b></i>. Do to the many experiments and projects we participate throuhgout the year, planning and designing of experiments is essential. Different projects, even if they involve similar experimental techniques, need to be planned and designed. <i>The experimental planning</i> includes, but is not limited to identifying the availability of resources (i.e. inventory control), creating sample maps (for storage and microplate location), identifying timeslots to carryout experiments, among others. The <i>experimental design*</i> includes, but is not limited to identifying techniques suitable to address the experimental question, calculating sample sizes, determining necessary statistical methods, among others. Planning and designing experiments not only benefits time management but also helps assign tasks, intra-lab resources, and contributes to the project management (discussed below) to deliver experimental outcomes in a timely and reproducible manner.</p></div>

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Experimental Documentation"></a><b><i>Experimental Documentation</i></b>. To yield reproducibility, documentation throughout the different stages of an experiment is fundamental. In the RIPLRT, we have deveveloped approaches to implement rigorous and transparent experimental documentation, including electrobic notebooks, cloud storage, among others. We also implement internal audits to monitor and improve our documentation. </p></div> 

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Project Planning and Management"></a><i><b>Project Planning and Management</b></i>. In the vast majority of cases, the experiments we implement in RIPLRT are linked to a project. Within a project, there are different epicycles that vary in duration, efforts, and resources. Here is were project planning and management comes into play to remain on track with time, efforts, and resources we imput into a project. When a new projects is to be launched, we come together to plan, for example, which tasks are needed, allocate personnel and material resources, and determine the duration and sequence of the tasks. Unless otherwise stated, in RIPLRT we practice with hard deadlines for each tasks. This skillset comes handy when concurrent projects are occuring in our working place.</p></div>

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Budget and Inventory Management"></a><i><b>Budget and Inventory Management</b></i>. How much a project will cost and impementing strategies to control how much we spend is another benefit of project planning and management (discussed above). As scientists, as pretty much in daily lives, understanding how needs to be spent (without under or overspending) is extremely important to carry out projects in the lab. Also, experimental planning and design helps control the inventory of consumables and specific reagents. In RIPLRT, we are cautious with how much needs to me spend for an experiment or project, and to take care of our man-hours and material resources.</p></div>

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Scientific Writing"></a><i><b>Scientific Writing</b></i>. A scientific finding that is not communicated, or informed incorrectly, is a finding not discovered. Therefore, in the RIPLRT we constantly seek to find opportunities to communincate our scientific fidings, and taking care to place these findings in public health and societal benefits. The scientific writing also benefits from the project planning and management (discussed above), and from the intra-collaboration (see team work below) within the RIPLRT. Becoming a good and efficient scientific writer takes a lot of work, effort, and patience.</p></div>

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Grant Writing"></a><i><b>Grant Writing</b></i>. Among the challenging skillsets as scientists is to become competitive in writing grants. The scientific aspect of grant writing involved many different phases and epicycles, including (but not limited to), 1) identifying an innovative and relevant idea, 2) match this idea to approprite experimental methods, 3) elaborate how expected outcomes will benefit society, 4) what will be future directions after a proposed project is completed, 6) and convince peers that your proposed project should be the one funded and that your team (or group of collabortators) is fit to carry out the project. In addition to communicate all of the above in a scientific-concise manner, budget, project planning, and other aspects (some already discussed above) come into play. Therefore, in the RIPLRT we continuously seek to identify grant opportunities and ideas that fit these funding opportunities.</p></div>

---
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Data Science"></a><i><b>Data Science</b></i>. In recent years, there has been an increase scrutiny on the statistics behind scientific findings. Furthermore, many peer-reviewed journals and funding organization (both goverment and private-non-profit) seek that the statistical methods be reproducible. These two requirements benefit from implementation of computational approaches to handle, analyze, and extract meaning from datasets. In the RIPLRT, we have extensive expertise in data management and analysis, including in the integrating the epicycles of data sciences. Given that this skillsets has a step learning curve, mentoring in this area takes planning and lots of patience -- an mentees to not be affraid of errors when writing computational codes.</p></div>
