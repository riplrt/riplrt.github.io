subtitle: RIPLRT's approaches to accompish our scientific mission
--- 

As described in [our mission](https://www.riplrt.com/mission/), our main scientific interest is addressing the physiological human health respiratory effects in response to environmental stressors: pollutants of different chemical origins and environmental sources. In line wit our scientific mission, we employ,

- [Exposure Science](#Exposure Science)
- [Human-Based Immunotoxicology](#Human-Based Immunotoxicology)
- [Computational Data Science](#Computational Data Science) 
- [Big Data Analytics](#Big Data Analytics)

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>As stated by the US National Academies of Science in the book <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13507/exposure-science-in-the-21st-century-a-vision-and-a" target="_blank">Exposure Science in the 21st Century:
A Vision and a Strategy</a>, exposure science (with regards to human beings) links the <b>a)</b> origin of the pollutant and its concentration from a giving source, <b>b)</b> the human behavior during or as result of the exposure, <b>c)</b> the interaction between the pollutant and the human subject, and <b>d)</b> and the outcome of this interaction. Depending on the nature of the question we want to address, and the project (often in a collaborative manner) in which we engage, here in RIPLRT we often address two or more of the concepts of exposure science</p></div>
