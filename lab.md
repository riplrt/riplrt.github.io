title: What we Do!
subtitle: RIPLRT's approaches to accompish our scientific mission
--- 

As described in [our mission](https://www.riplrt.com/mission/), our main scientific interest is addressing the physiological human health respiratory effects in response to environmental stressors: pollutants of different chemical origins and environmental sources. In line with our scientific mission, we employ,

- [Exposure Science](#Exposure Science)
- [Human-Based Immunotoxicology](#Human-Based Immunotoxicology)
- [Computational Data Science](#Computational Data Science)

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><u><b>Exposure Science</b></u>. As stated by the US National Academies of Science in the book <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13507/exposure-science-in-the-21st-century-a-vision-and-a" target="_blank">Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy</a>, exposure science (with regards to human beings) links the <b>a)</b> origin of the pollutant and its concentration from a giving source, <b>b)</b> the human behavior during or as result of the exposure, <b>c)</b> the interaction between the pollutant and the human subject, and <b>d)</b> the outcome of this interaction. Depending on the nature of the question we want to address, and the project (often in a collaborative manner) in which we engage, we often address two or more of the concepts of exposure science</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><u><b>Human-Based Immunotoxicology</b></u>. To align our findings of biomarker profiles in response to environmental pollutants, we employ human-based immunological approaches (see the red arrow in the image). Our PI and mentor (Dr. Rivera-Mariani) has a long track of expanding the utility of immunological approaches into new areas of research as evidenced <a href="https://lushprize.org/awards/young-researcher-prize/" target="_blank">here (refer to the bottom of the page of this link)</a>. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><u><b>Computational Data Science</b></u>. It is a difficult case for science when there are relevant findings, but the statistical approaches are not reproducible. In RIPLRT, we employ <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>,  <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">Matlab</a> to make our data science reproducible. We also make our data science scripts, and often our raw data, available in online repositories such as <a href="https://github.com/riplrt" target="_blank">Github</a>, the <a href="https://osf.io/" target="_blank">Open Science Framework</a>,  <a href="https://figshare.com/" target="_blank">FigShare</a>, or <a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>.</p></div>
