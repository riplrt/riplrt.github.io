<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Dr. Rivera-Mariani, Assistant Professor and Academic Director in the <a href="http://ularkin.org/college-of-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank">College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University</a>, is an expert immunologist, microbiologist, aerobiologist, and computational biologist. At Larkin University, Dr. Rivera-Mariani, in addition to carrying out scientific research, teaches biochemistry, immunology, and molecular genetics. Among the academic credentials of Dr. Rivera-Mariani include a B.S. in Biology with a minor in Chemistry (Southeastern Louisiana University under an athletic scholarship), Ph.D. in Microbiology and Medical Zoology (School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico - Medical Sciences Campus), post-doctoral fellowship in Environmental Health Sciences (the Bloomberg School of Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University), and Science Teaching Fellowship (American Society for Microbiology).</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Dr. Rivera-Mariani is also a strong supporter of reproducibility in sciences and thus has gained specializations in Data Science, Genomic Data Sciences, Executive Data Science, Software Development (Johns Hopkins University), Systems Biology (Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai), and Bioinformatics (University of California at San Diego). Through these specializations, Dr. Rivera-Mariani has developed extensive experience as a programmer in the R, Python, and Matlab computer languages.</p></div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>At Larkin University, Dr. Rivera-Mariani seeks to mentor students and young researchers in the different pipelines and epicycles of scientific research, and through the RIPL Effect team provide further insight into the immunotoxicology of airborne pollutants of different chemical origins. He has published extensively in this line of research (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Felix_Rivera-Mariani/publications" target="_blank">click here for additional information</a>).</p></div>

<img src="/img/Ariel.jpg" alt="Ariel Stateman" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; margin:8px"> <a name="Ariel Stateman"></a>***Ariel Stateman*** (**Research Assistant - Intern**)
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ariel recently graduated from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, Ariel earned a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, she participated in scientific research- studying the sensing in lean and obese individuals through rats. She has an extensive experience in clinical observations from her internships at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, IL. Among her prospective professional plans, she hopes to earn her doctorate degree.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ariel's trayectory in the RIPLRT dates back to the very beginnings of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG) just after Dr. Rivera-Mariani joined the Larkin University community. While being a graduate student at the College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University, together with Josh (refer to Josh bio), she was the co-leader of the our research group (now the RIPL_Effect Research Team).</p></div>

<img src="/img/Hayat.jpg" alt="Hayat Srour" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px"> <a name="Hayat Srour"></a>***Hayat Srour*** (**Research Assistant and Lab Manager**)
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat, from Detroit, Michigan, is also a graduate from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, she earned a B.A. in Anthropology from Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan). Her interest in scientific research stems from her passion for medicine and philanthropy. Among her diverse goals, she aspires to become a physician that actively works toward global equality.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat's leadership dates back to the beginnigs of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG). When the group was created, Hayat was assigned the task of being the spokesperson of the group. Her leadership was also employed as a student representative in the Advisory Committee of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Therefore, it is no surprise that her peers fully support her being the Lab Manager of the RIPLRT. </p></div>

<img src="/img/Joshua.jpeg" alt="Joshua Baguley" align="right" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; margin:8px"> <a name="Joshua Baguley"></a>***Joshua Baguley*** (**Research Assistant - Intern**)  
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Josh grew up in Indonesia and then moved to Waco, Texas where he attended Baylor University to complete a B.S. in Biochemistry. He spent the majority of his time at Baylor working as an undergraduate researcher, specializing in DNA manipulation and protein purification. His work in the lab mainly focused on the functions and effects of replication factors MCM8, MCM9, Dpo1, and Dpo4 on the DNA replisome. Joshua was also a member of the Baylor Volleyball club team. Joshua is also a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University.</p></div>
