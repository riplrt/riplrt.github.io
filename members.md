<img src="/img/Ariel.jpg" alt="Ariel Stateman" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; margin:8px"> <a name="Ariel Stateman"></a>***Ariel Stateman*** (**Research Assistant - Intern**)
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ariel recently graduated from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, Ariel earned a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, she participated in scientific research- studying the sensing in lean and obese individuals through rats. She has an extensive experience in clinical observations from her internships at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, IL. Among her prospective professional plans, she hopes to earn her doctorate degree.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ariel's trayectory in the RIPLRT dates back to the very beginnings of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG) just after Dr. Rivera-Mariani joined the Larkin University community. While being a graduate student at the College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University, together with Josh (refer to Josh bio), she was the co-leader of the our research group (now the RIPL_Effect Research Team).</p></div>

<img src="/img/Hayat.jpg" alt="Hayat Srour" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px"> <a name="Hayat Srour"></a>***Hayat Srour*** (**Research Assistant and Lab Manager**)
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat, from Detroit, Michigan, is also a graduate from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, she earned a B.A. in Anthropology from Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan). Her interest in scientific research stems from her passion for medicine and philanthropy. Among her diverse goals, she aspires to become a physician that actively works toward global equality.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat's leadership dates back to the beginnigs of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG). When the group was created, Hayat was assigned the task of being the spokesperson of the group. Her leadership was also employed as a student representative in the Advisory Committee of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Therefore, it is no surprise that her peers fully support her being the Lab Manager of the RIPLRT. </p></div>

<img src="/img/Joshua.jpeg" alt="Joshua Baguley" align="right" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; margin:8px"> <a name="Joshua Baguley"></a>***Joshua Baguley*** (**Research Assistant - Intern**)  
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Josh grew up in Indonesia and then moved to Waco, Texas where he attended Baylor University to complete a B.S. in Biochemistry. He spent the majority of his time at Baylor working as an undergraduate researcher, specializing in DNA manipulation and protein purification. His work in the lab mainly focused on the functions and effects of replication factors MCM8, MCM9, Dpo1, and Dpo4 on the DNA replisome. Joshua was also a member of the Baylor Volleyball club team. Joshua is also a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Josh, as mentioned in Ariel's trayectory, was the other co-leader of the group. His leadership was evident from the beginning (even before launching the research group), as well as when addressing different challenging situations within the group. We are proud of Josh recently starting a position in the Genomics Department at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston Texas. Nevertheless, his scientific heart still linked to the RIPLRT.</p></div>

<img src="/img/Ruslan.jpg" alt="Ruslan Fomentko" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px"> <a name="Ruslan Fomenko"></a>***Ruslan Fomenko*** (**Research Assistant - Intern**)
<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ruslan, also a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Larkin University, grew up in Kazakhstan and moved Virginia Beach, Virginia during his high school years. He later graduated from Christopher Newport University with a B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology with a Psychology minor, and later from Larkin University with a M.S. in Biomedical Sciences.  In addition to volunteering in various clinical environments, Ruslan also took part in an internship at Patient First (chain of patient care centers) as a licensed phlebotomist.  His undergraduate research was focused on the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of drought and salt-stressed Rosmarinus officinalis plants.</p></div>  

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ruslan emergence as a researcher has been evident in the group. In addition to being one of the phlebotomist of the RIPLRT (yes, we work with human tissues and body fluids), Ruslan has been very active in different projects within RIPLRT.</p></div>
