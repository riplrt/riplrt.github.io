<img src="/img/Ariel.jpg" alt="Ariel Stateman" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; margin:8px"> 
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Ariel Stateman"></a><i><b>Ariel Stateman (Research Assistant - Intern)</b></i>.Ariel recently graduated from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, Ariel earned a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, she participated in scientific research  studying the sensing in lean and obese individuals through rats. She has an extensive experience in clinical observations from her internships at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, IL. Among her prospective professional plans, she hopes to earn her doctorate degree.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ariel's trajectory in the RIPLRT dates back to the very beginnings of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG) just after Dr. Rivera-Mariani joined the Larkin University community. As a graduate student in the College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University, she was a co-leader with Josh (refer to Josh's bio) of our research group (now the RIPL_Effect Research Team).</p></div>

<img src="/img/Hayat.jpg" alt="Hayat Srour" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px">
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Hayat Srour"></a><i><b>Hayat Srour (Research Assistant and Lab Manager)</b></i>. Hayat, from Detroit, Michigan, is also a graduate from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, she earned a B.A. in Anthropology from Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan). Her interest in scientific research stems from her passion for medicine and philanthropy. Among her diverse goals, she aspires to become a physician that actively works toward global equality.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat's leadership dates back to the beginnigs of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG). When the group was created, Hayat was assigned the task of being the spokesperson of the group. Her leadership was also employed as a student representative in the Advisory Committee of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Therefore, it is no surprise that her peers fully support her as the Lab Manager of the RIPLRT. </p></div>

<img src="/img/Joshua.jpeg" alt="Joshua Baguley" align="right" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; margin:8px"> 
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Joshua Baguley"></a><i><b>Joshua Baguley (Research Assistant - Intern)</b></i>.  Josh grew up in Indonesia and then moved to Waco, Texas where he attended Baylor University to complete a B.S. in Biochemistry. He spent the majority of his time at Baylor working as an undergraduate researcher, specializing in DNA manipulation and protein purification. His work in the lab mainly focused on the functions and effects of replication factors MCM8, MCM9, Dpo1, and Dpo4 on the DNA replisome. Joshua was also a member of the Baylor Volleyball club team. He is now a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Josh, as mentioned in Ariel's bio, was the other co-leader of the group. His leadership was evident from the beginning (even before launching the research group), as well as when addressing different challenging situations within the group. We are proud of Josh new position (well, not so new anymore) in the Genomics Department at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston Texas. Nevertheless, his scientific heart is still linked to the RIPLRT.</p></div>

<img src="/img/Ruslan.jpg" alt="Ruslan Fomentko" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px"> 
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Ruslan Fomenko"></a><i><b>Ruslan Fomenko (Research Assistant - Intern)</b></i>. Ruslan, also a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Larkin University, grew up in Kazakhstan and moved Virginia Beach, Virginia during his high school years. He graduated from Christopher Newport University with a B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology with a Psychology minor, and later from Larkin University with a M.S. in Biomedical Sciences.  In addition to volunteering in various clinical environments, Ruslan took part in an internship at Patient First (chain of patient care centers) as a licensed phlebotomist.  His undergraduate research was focused on the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of drought and salt-stressed Rosmarinus officinalis plants.</p></div>  

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ruslan's emergence as a researcher has been evident in the group. In addition to being one of the phlebotomists of the RIPLRT (yes, we work with human tissues and body fluids), Ruslan has been very active in different projects within RIPLRT.</p></div>

Shandra, originally from Maryland, received her B.S. in Biology from Frostburg State University. During her undergraduate studies, she held multiple positions on various leadership boards and made the Dean's list numerous times. She has spent a considerable amount of time working in clinical environments, such as the Emergency Department and volunteering at the University of Maryland Medical Center, Shock Trauma. Though she enjoys the clinical environment, she is excited to venture into scientific research because of her curiosity about how the human body works and is affected. She recently graduated from the M.S. in Biomedical Science program at Larkin University and plans to continue working and volunteering in the healthcare field to help uplift the community and make changes where and when it’s possible. Her goal is to attend Medical School in the future.</p></div>  

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Shandra's attention to detail is one of her many contributions to the RIPLRT. For this reason, when we were the RIPLRG, Shandra was assigned the task of being the Lead Editor. This role included revising reports, our websites, among other publications from our research group. Not least important are her leadership and maturity, which  served as examples to many students at Larkin University.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Summer Pellechio"></a><i><b>Summer Pellechio (Research Assistant)</b></i>. Summer recently graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY) with a B.S. Biomedical Sciences. She originally matriculated as an Industrial Design student, seeking a people-oriented career that would integrate her empathy and creative thinking. Her ambition to meaningfully utilize these strengths moved her to healthcare sciences and to aspire to become a Physician Assistant. She has clinical experience with patients from working as an EMT in the city of Rochester and for RIT’s collegiate EMS agency, where she’s served as the Training Director. She’s also a certified phlebotomist. Her undergraduate lab work focused on the frequencies of anergic gene polymorphisms associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in sickle cell disease populations. She feels fortunate that her strong work ethic and curiosity have led her to join the RIPL Effect Research Team.</p></div>

In 2014 she received a double major in Industrial Microbiology and Biology at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. During her undergraduate education, she worked in the Symbiosis Laboratory of Dr. Cafaro investigating the antifungal capacity of Actinobacteria associated to the exoskeleton of the termite Nasutitermes costalis. She’s currently working in her research thesis at the Mycology Laboratory of Dr. Bolaños, studying the effect of Hurricane María in the indoor concentration of fungi and the health outcomes of the habitants.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Currently, she’s the President of the Microbiology Chapter of her campus where she promotes and organizes professional and educative outreach activities for the community. Outside academia, Lorraine enjoys dancing salsa, visiting new restaurants and kayaking.</p></div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>In the RIPLRT, Lorraine looks forward to train on the different human-based immunological approaches we implement in environmental health studies. Also, she looks forward to learning the experimental planning and design, project management and execution, as well as data management and analysis we implement when deploying human-based immunological approaches to study the respiratory health risks resulting from human exposures to air pollution. Lorraine will be implementing in her thesis studies the skill sets she will learn with the RIPLRT.</p></div>
