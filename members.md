<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Hayat Srour"></a><i><b>Hayat Srour (Research Assistant and Lab Manager)</b></i>. Hayat, from Detroit, Michigan, is also a graduate from the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Before joining Larkin, she earned a B.A. in Anthropology from Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan). Her interest in scientific research stems from her passion for medicine and philanthropy. Among her diverse goals, she aspires to become a physician that actively works toward global equality. She is making good strides in this direction by also currently working as a Physician Assistant Scribe. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Hayat's leadership dates back to the beginnigs of the RIPLRT (back then the RIPLRG). When the group was created, Hayat was assigned the task of being the spokesperson of the group. Her leadership was also employed as a student representative in the Advisory Committee of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program at Larkin University. Therefore, it is no surprise that her peers fully support her as the Lab Manager of the RIPLRT. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Ruslan Fomenko"></a><i><b>Ruslan Fomenko (Research Assistant)</b></i>. Ruslan, also a recent graduate of the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Larkin University, grew up in Kazakhstan and moved Virginia Beach, Virginia during his high school years. He graduated from Christopher Newport University with a B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology with a Psychology minor, and later from Larkin University with a M.S. in Biomedical Sciences.  In addition to volunteering in various clinical environments, Ruslan took part in an internship at Patient First (chain of patient care centers) as a licensed phlebotomist.  His undergraduate research was focused on the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of drought and salt-stressed Rosmarinus officinalis plants.</p></div>  

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Ruslan's emergence as a researcher has been evident in the group. In addition to being one of the phlebotomists of the RIPLRT (yes, we work with human tissues and body fluids), Ruslan has been very active in different projects within the RIPLRT.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Sukeina Nasser"></a><i><b>Sukeina Nasser (we know her as Sukie)</b></i> is from Detroit, MI and is a 2nd year student at Larkin University College of Pharmacy. Her interest in drug research development, specifically in ways to create less addictive and more effective medications, is what lead her to pursue a career in pharmacy. Although her passion remains in pharmacy, she is also dedicated to the opportunity to work with the RIPL research team. Having family who live in Puerto Rico, and we’re affected first hand by the destruction of Hurricane Maria, she has sincere interest in the work that RIPL conducts regarding respiratory immunology issues that are being felt by so many individuals from the aftermath of Maria. Sukeina hopes to gain knowledge and experience from a Biomedical standpoint, while also hoping to offer some insight from a pharmacy background. She is excited to learn and grow alongside the RIPL team. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Summer Pellechio"></a><i><b>Summer Pellechio (Research Assistant)</b></i>. Summer recently graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY) with a B.S. Biomedical Sciences. She originally matriculated as an Industrial Design student, seeking a people-oriented career that would integrate her empathy and creative thinking. Her ambition to meaningfully utilize these strengths moved her to healthcare sciences and to aspire to become a Physician Assistant. She has clinical experience with patients from working as an EMT in the city of Rochester and for RIT’s collegiate EMS agency, where she’s served as the Training Director. She’s also a certified phlebotomist. Her undergraduate lab work focused on the frequencies of anergic gene polymorphisms associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in sickle cell disease populations. She feels fortunate that her strong work ethic and curiosity have led her to join the RIPLRT.</p></div>

<img src="/img/Lorraine.jpeg" alt="Lorraine Vélez-Torres" align="right" style="width: 15%; height: 15%; margin:8px"> 
<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Lorraine Vélez-Torres"></a><i><b>Lorraine Torres-Vélez (Ph.D. candidate - University of Puerto Rico - Medical Sciences Campus).</b></i>
Lorraine is a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology at the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus. She earned her master’s degree in Public Health with concentration in Epidemiology in 2015, identifying the risk factors affecting the quality of life of residents in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. In 2014 she received a double major in Industrial Microbiology and Biology at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. During her undergraduate education, she worked in the Symbiosis Laboratory of Dr. Cafaro investigating the antifungal capacity of Actinobacteria associated to the exoskeleton of the termite Nasutitermes costalis. She’s currently working in her research thesis at the Mycology Laboratory of Dr. Bolaños, studying the effect of Hurricane María in the indoor concentration of fungi and the health outcomes of the habitants.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Currently, she’s the President of the Microbiology Chapter of her campus where she promotes and organizes professional and educative outreach activities for the community. Outside academia, Lorraine enjoys dancing salsa, visiting new restaurants and kayaking.</p></div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"><p> Because Dr. Rivera-Mariani is a member of the thesis committee of Lorraine, she was invited for and completed a one-week training with the RIPLRT to learn the different human-based immunological approaches we implement in environmental health studies. Also, she trained on the experimental planning and design, project management and execution, as well as data management and analysis we implement when deploying human-based immunological approaches to study the respiratory health risks resulting from human exposures to air pollution. Lorraine will be implementing in her thesis studies the skill sets she will learned with the RIPLRT.</p></div>
