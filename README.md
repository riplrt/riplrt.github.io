RIPL (Respiratory and Immunology Project at [Larkin](http://ularkin.org/college-of-biomedical-sciences/)) Effect

## Summary
This github respository contains the files of the ***RIPL Effect*** research team. [Click here to access the RIPL_Effect research group's website](https://www.riplrt.com)

## Goals
Our main scientific goal is *to provide further insight into the immuno-physiological health effects that airborne pollutants of different chemical origins induce once they cross the human respiratory barrier among susceptible indivudals (e.g. people suffering from asthma, respiratory allergies, and other chronic respiratory conditions).*

The ***RIPL Effect*** research team will also serve as a venue for students to put into practice their knowledge in biomedical sciences, carry out high-quality scientific research, and exemplify:

- **inclusiveness** (in the RIPL Effect team, everyone's voice count)
- **multi-disciplinarity** (different disciplines will be integrated to reach our goals)
- **diversity** (we will value and respect differences in perspectives and opinions)
- **integrity** (our science will follow strict institutional, scientific, and ethical guidelines)
- **productivity** (we will input our highest efforts to reach our goals)
- **innovation** (we will remain open-minded, and will learn from both successes and failures)
- **excellence** (the highest quality of scientific research will always be our target)
- **collaboration** (what is done in isolation is often accomplished better in partnership)
- **leadership** (we will nourish from a culture of intra and inter-motivation and inspiration)
