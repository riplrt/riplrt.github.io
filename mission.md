title: Our Mission
subtitle: The RIPLRT's research and educational missions
---

Our main scientific goal is to provide further insight into the immuno-physiological health effects that airborne pollutants of different chemical origins induce once they cross the human respiratory barrier among susceptible individuals (e.g. people suffering from asthma, respiratory allergies, and other chronic respiratory conditions). We seek to address our scientific questions by integrating human-based immuno-physiological approaches, molecular biology, and computational biology.
 
The RIPL Effect research team also serves as a venue for the core of the team, <strong>our researchers (current and former graduate students)</strong>, to carry out high-quality scientific research and exemplify:


- **Inclusiveness** (everyoneâ€™s voice count)
- **Multi-disciplinary** focus (integrate different disciplines into our reach goals)
- **Diversity** (value and respect differences in perspectives and opinions)
- **Integrity** (follow strict institutional, scientific, and ethical guidelines)
- **Productivity** (input our highest efforts to reach our goals)
- **Innovation** (remain open-minded, and will learn from both successes and failures)
- **Excellence** (target the highest quality of scientific research)
- **Collaboration** (what is done in isolation is often accomplished better in partnership)
- **Leadership** (nourish from a culture of intra and inter-motivation and inspiration)
